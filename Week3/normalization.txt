What columns violate 1NF?

The row with id=1,id=3 are duplicate and that violates 1NF .
member_address datatype is different it is better to have a separate column for postcode .
same issue with dinner_date values are not of the same type .
Not a single value in food_code and food_description .

What entities do you recognize that could be extracted?

dinner_id and dinner_date should be extracted to another table same for
 (venue_code,venue_description),(food_code,food_description)

 Name all the tables and columns that would make a 3NF compliant solution.
table member columns(member_id pk,member_name,member_address)

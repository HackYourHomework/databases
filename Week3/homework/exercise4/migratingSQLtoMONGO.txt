Go to https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas and create an account. Accept default settings.

Create cluster. Set up Network Access, add IP address 'allow access from anywhere'(for simplicity).

Create database. Inside Database User add new database user. Inside 'Database user privileges'
choose option 'Atlas Admin'.

Go to https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass download the app run it and follow all the steps
to make registration.

Go back to your Atlas account. Inside of your cluster press on 'connect' and choose option 'Connect
using MongoDB Compass' and then option 'I have MongoDB account'.

Copy the collection sting, then go back to MangoDB.

Paste that string under 'Click edit to modify your connection sting' and replace.
Change <username> and <password> to those you used creating admin account in Atlas.
Press 'connect'.

Create database 'world' with 3 collections 'city','country','countrylanguage'.

Open mysql in terminal. Select database world by typing 'use world;'

Copy query from the exercise:
'select * into outfile 'city.csv' FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' from city;'
That query should give an error!
To solve that write:
mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE "secure_file_priv";

Example of the result:
+------------------+-------------------------------+
| Variable_name    | Value                         |
+------------------+-------------------------------+
| secure_file_priv | /Users/hyf-student/Documents/ |
+------------------+-------------------------------+
Copy the value of 'secure_file_priv' and paste if in the query that gave an error, before 'city.csv'
Example:
'select * into outfile '/Users/hyf-student/Documents/city.csv' FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' from city;'

Following the root find that file and open it in your local editor.

You can see table 'city' displayed as a tab.
Columns have values, but all columns have no description.


Add one row the top of the tab and give every column a name taken from the table 'city'
according to it's value.
+-------------+
| Field       |
+-------------+
| ID          |
| Name        |
| CountryCode |
| District    |
| Population  | 
+-------------+

Save file, make sure it's in .csv format!

Go to MongoDB Compass choose collection 'city' from database 'world'.

Press 'Import data' => 'cvs' => 'browse'  navigate to 'city.csv' file.

Specify type of every column according to it's value (sting, number,etc...)

Press 'Import'

Now go back to your MongoDB Atlas account 

Choose: clusters => world => collections => city
You can see all the values from table city from mysql were migrated to your MongoDB Atlas account 

Repeat the same thing for tables 'country' and 'countrylanguage'.

IMPORTANT NOTE: migrating 'country' table add 'ENCLOSED BY '"'' to the given query
example:
'/Users/nizamimursudlu/desktop/country1.csv' FIELDS ENCLOSED BY '"'  TERMINATED BY ',' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' from country;

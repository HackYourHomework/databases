1-I installed mongoDB compass and atlas.

2-I imported the .csv files into mongo using the mongoDB compass
first by creating world database and then the collection city, country, country_language and then start importing data into them.

3-I created an account on Atlas but I cant do a connection between the compass or shell and atlas so I will use the localhost

4-I use these commands:
select _ into outfile '<path file>city.csv' FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINS TERMINATED BY '\n' from city;
select _ into outfile '<path file>country.csv' FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINS TERMINATED BY '\n' from country;
select \* into outfile '<path file>country_language.csv' FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINS TERMINATED BY '\n' from country_language;

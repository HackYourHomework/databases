1 -What columns violate 1NF?
       
    column member_address 
        Attribute domain should not change, as we can see here this column contain different data type (int and charset), the solution for this is to have two separate columns for each data type as memeber_houseNumber( type: int) and member_street_name(type : varchar).
        
    column dinner_date 
        violates the 1NF, should contain the same Date format and same domain

    column food_code,  column food_description 
       the columns here voilates the 1NF rules because each attribute contains two values  (each column should have atomic value no multiple values)

2 - What entities do you recognize that could be extracted?
    member_address column 
        has to be extracted into two columns, as member_houseNumber( type: int) and member_street_name(type : varchar).

    food_code column and food_description column
        extract the multiple values by creating more columns each column conatins one value to avoid the violation

    dinner_date 
        move into different table e.g dinner table because its  a nono-prime attribute that functionally dependent  on a proper subset of a candidate key 
    venue_description
         move into different table e.g venue table because its a nono-prime attribute  that functionally dependent  on a proper subset of a candidate key 
    food_description
         move into different table e.g food table because its a nono-prime attribute  that functionally dependent  on a proper subset of a candidate key 

3- Name all the tables and columns that would make a 3NF compliant  solution.    
    we will have to create 4 tables
    member table
         member_id int primary key
         member_house_number int
         member_street_name varchar(50)
         dinner_id int foreign key references dinner table
         venue_code varchar(50) foreign key references venue table
         food_code varchar(50) foreign key references food table

    dinner table
        dinner_id int primary key
        dinner_description varchar(50)
        dinner_date date

    venue table
        venue_code varchar(50) primary key
        venue_description varchar(50)

    food table
        food_code varchar(50) primary key
        food_name varchar(50)
        food_description varchar(50)

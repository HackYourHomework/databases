1 -What columns violate 1NF?
           
    column dinner_date 
        violates the 1NF, should contain the same Date format and same domain

    column food_code,  column food_description 
       the columns here voilates the 1NF rules because each attribute contains two values  (each column should have atomic value no multiple values)

2 - What entities do you recognize that could be extracted?
    
    food_code column and food_description column
        extract the multiple values by creating more columns each column conatins one value to avoid the violation
    dinner_date 
        move into different table e.g dinner table because its  a nono-prime attribute that functionally dependent  on a proper subset of a candidate key 
    venue_description
         move into different table e.g venue table because its a nono-prime attribute  that functionally dependent  on a proper subset of a candidate key 
    food_description
         move into different table e.g food table because its a nono-prime attribute  that functionally dependent  on a proper subset of a candidate key 

3- Name all the tables and columns that would make a 3NF compliant  solution.    
    we will have to create 5 tables

    
    member table
         member_id int primary key
         member_name varchar(50)
         member_address varchar(50)

    venue table
        venue_code varchar(50) primary key
        venue_description varchar(50)

    food table
        food_code varchar(50) primary key
        food_description varchar(50)
        venue_code varchar(50) foreign key references venue table

    dinner table
        dinner_id int primary key
        dinner_date date
      
    member-dinner table 
        member-id foreign key references member table
        dinner_id foreign key references dinner table
        food_code varchar(50) foreign key references food table

1- I extract the tables (city,country,countrylanguage) from world mysql database into three .csv files (city.csv,country.csv,countrylanguage.csv).
   I added the header also so the data will be better while I insert the keys and values in MongoDB.
   And Union will merge them on top of each other.

    - This query to extract city table, I don't have to extract the ID column from city table (MongoDB will generate ID for each document),
      The delimiter here is comma.

        SELECT 'Name', 'CountryCode', 'District', 'Population'
        UNION ALL
        select Name, CountryCode, District, Population into outfile 'C:\\ProgramData\\MySQL\\MySQL Server 8.0\\Uploads\\city.csv'
        FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' 
        from city;

    - This query to extract country table, The delimiter here is semicolon, because I have rows have multiple values with comma between them!

        SELECT 'Code', 'Name', 'Continent', 'Region', 'SurfaceArea', 'IndepYear', 'Population', 'LifeExpectancy', 'GNP', 'GNPOld', 'LocalName', 'GovernmentForm', 'HeadOfState', 'Capital', 'Code2'
        UNION ALL
        select * into outfile 'C:\\ProgramData\\MySQL\\MySQL Server 8.0\\Uploads\\country.csv'
        FIELDS TERMINATED BY ';' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' 
        from country;

    - This query to extract countrylanguage table, The delimiter here is comma.
        
        SELECT 'CountryCode', 'Language', 'IsOfficial', 'Percentage'
        UNION ALL
        select * into outfile 'C:\\ProgramData\\MySQL\\MySQL Server 8.0\\Uploads\\countrylanguage.csv'
        FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' 
        from countrylanguage;


2- Create account on Atlas, install Compass from MongoDB website, test the connection:
    - Create account on Atlas, setup the ip address (using current ip address), create a user (with a password), and choose type of connection (with Shell, Compass or Application).
    - Install Compass and create a new Connection with Atlas (use the correct connection string from Atlas) : mongodb+srv://KholiO-Atlas:<password>@cluster0.vylqe.mongodb.net/test
    - Create a connection with Command Prompt Shell: mongo "mongodb+srv://cluster0.vylqe.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase" --username KholiO-Atlas
        In this step you have to make sure that your system environment properties path has the path of your mongodb Shell.

    - Test the connection between Shell, Compass and Atlas:
        - Create a database (contain collections) in Atlas and do operations on it
        - Any change on Atlas should reflect on Shell and Compass  and vice versa.

3- Create world database on Atlas contain 3 collections (city,country,countrylanguage)
    - Create world database on Compass and city collection (you have to create a collection also, otherwise you couldn't see the database)
    - Import city.csv as data to fill in city collection: choose comma delimiter and correct data type for fields.
    - Import country.csv as data to fill in country collection: choose semicolon delimiter and correct data type for fields.
    - Import countrylanguage.csv as data to fill in countrylanguage collection: choose comma delimiter and correct data type for fields.

4- Test by type db.city.find().pretty on Shell, it will print all documents in city collection.

What columns violate 1NF?

1NF (4 rules):

    1- Single valued columns (each column should have atomic value, no multiple values):
    These columns (member_address,food_code,food_description) violate this rule (they have multiple values).
    2- Column domain (for any column) should not change:
    This column (dinner_date) violate this rule (even it has same data type, but the domain is different).
    3- Unique names for columns:
    Non of the columns violate this rule.
    4- Order (of rows/columns) does not matter.
    Non of the columns violate this rule.

    We can solve this design by extracting columns (Next exercise).

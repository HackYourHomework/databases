3NF Rules (2NF rules + rule)
    No transitive dependency (i.e. no column should depend on non-key column).

To make the table in 3NF, we have to create 4 extra tables:
    1- building table : has 2 columns: building_no(int primary key)     , building_name(varchar).
    2- dinner table   : has 2 columns: dinner_id(int primary key)       , dinner_date(date).
    3- venue table    : has 2 columns: venue_code(varchar primary key)  , venue_description(varchar).
    4- food table     : has 2 columns: food_code(varchar primary key)   , food_description(varchar).

And we still have member table which has 6 columns:
    member_id(int primary key),
    member_name(varchar),
    building_no(int foreign key from building table),
    dinner_id(int foreign key from dinner table),
    venue_code(varchar foreign key from venue table),
    food_code(varchar foreign key from food table)

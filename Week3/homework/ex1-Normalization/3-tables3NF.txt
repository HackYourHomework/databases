3NF Rules (2NF rules + rule)
    No transitive dependency (i.e. no column should depend on non-key column).

To make the table in 3NF, we have to create 4 extra tables:
    1- dinner table   : has 2 columns: dinner_id(int primary key)       , dinner_date(date).
    2- venue table    : has 2 columns: venue_code(varchar primary key)  , venue_description(varchar).
    3- food table     : has 3 columns: food_code(varchar primary key)   , food_description(varchar), venue_code(foreign key from venue table)
    4- members_dinner : has 3 columns: member_id(foreign key from member table), dinner_id(foreign key from dinner table), food_code(foreign key from food table)
    
And we still have member table which has:
    member_id(int primary key),
    member_name(varchar),
    member_address(varchar)

1- Give an example of a value that can be passed as name and code that would take advantage of SQL-injection 
  and (fetch all the records in the database)

- We can passed s' OR '3'='3 (which is always true) as name and b' OR '2'='2 as code (which is always true).
- We can passed (anyName' OR '5'='5) as name and (anyName' OR '7'='7) as code.
- If we want to run multiple Statements we have to set [multipleStatements: true;]

2- To fetch all the Population records in the database the query would be:
`SELECT Population FROM ${Country} WHERE Name = ('${name}' OR '5'='5) AND (code = '${code}' OR '5'='5);`

3- If we want to fetch all records from Country table after fetch Population records the query would be:
`SELECT Population FROM ${Country} WHERE Name = (`${name}` OR '1'='1) AND (code = `${code}` OR '1'='1); SELECT * FROM  Country;`

4- In rewriteTheFunction.js file I explained all cases!

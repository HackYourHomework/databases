1- What columns violate 1NF?

First These columns (member_address,food_code,food_description) was violated the rule  of (every column should only contain a single value) but they have multiple values.
Secondly This column (dinner_date) violate the rule of (the domain should not change).

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

We can solve this design by extracting columns (Next exercise).

We have to extracting these entities:

(member_address,food_code,food_description,dinner_date).
** member_address: Extract this column into 2 column (building_no hold integer data type, building_name hold varchar data type).
**  food_code: To avoid insert multiple data, we can extract this column into multiple columns (food_code1,food_code2,food_code3,.....).
**  food_description: To avoid insert multiple data, 
    we can extract this column into multiple columns (food_description1,food_description2,food_description3).
**  dinner_date: To avoid inset data in different domains, 
    we can extract this column into 3 columns (dinner_day ,dinner_month ,dinner_year)

Name all the tables and columns that would make a 3NF compliant solution.

    the tables and columns that would make a 3NF compliant solution., we have to create 4 extra tables:

    1- building table : has 2 columns: building_no(primary key)     , building_name.
    2- dinner table   : has 2 columns: dinner_id(primary key)       , dinner_date.
    3- venue table    : has 2 columns: venue_code(primary key)  , venue_description.
    4- food table     : has 2 columns: food_code(primary key)   , food_description.
